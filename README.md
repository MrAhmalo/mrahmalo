### Hi there 👋
- 🔭 I’m currently working on SleepParalyza, a newly horror game made by iliketomoveit007 and me
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, HTML and developing websites generally
- 🔗 Visit my portfolio: https://portfolio.golegana.de

I am very interested in developing and making games. I like learning new things and gaining new experience. 🌐🧑‍💻
Also I love designing and scripting UI's in general but especially in Roblox.
This is why I also started sellign them on Fiverr.
