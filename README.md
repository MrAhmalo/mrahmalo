### Hi there 👋
- 🔭 I’m currently getting into the HomeAssistant/SmartHome scene.
- 🌱 Lately, I’ve been learning JavaScript and Java.
- 🔗 Visit my portfolio: https://portfolio.golegana.de

I like learning new things and gaining new experience. 🌐🧑‍💻 <br/>
Also I love designing and scripting UI's in general but especially in Roblox. <br/>
This is why I also started selling them on Fiverr. <br/>
